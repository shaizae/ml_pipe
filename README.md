# ml_pipe

A scikit-learn package for running many tests in multiprocessing with minimal garbage creation:
every model x feature subset x hyper-parameter combination, scored on the same splits, best ones refitted.

## Install

```
pip install -e .            # the library
pip install -e ".[dev]"     # + test tools
```

```python
import ml_pipe
from ml_pipe import Classification, FilteringCriteriaClassification

with Classification() as run:
    run.set(X, y, [RandomForestClassifier(), SVC()])
    run.features.standard_scaler()
    run.k_folds(5)
    best = run.filter_by(FilteringCriteriaClassification.accuracy)
```

## Command line

```
ml-pipe init experiment.toml          # example config with every option explained
ml-pipe run experiment.toml --check   # validate the config and the data, no training
ml-pipe run experiment.toml           # train every configuration
ml-pipe predict runs/<date_time>/1_<Model>/model.joblib new.csv -o predictions.csv --proba
```

`python -m ml_pipe ...` works too. A config names the data file, target column and task, the models (any
scikit-learn class name, or an import path like `xgboost.XGBClassifier`), a hyper-parameter grid, preprocessing,
optional feature selection and the validation. Each run writes a new `runs/<date_time>/` folder with
`leaderboard.csv` (every configuration, best first; ties go to fewer features), a copy of the config, and the
top `keep` models, each in its own folder with `model.joblib` and a PDF report.

## Use a trained model

```python
path = best[0].save_model("models")       # a .joblib file in models/
model = ml_pipe.load(path)                # only load files you trust
model.predict(new_df)                     # picks the training columns by name; returns the original labels
model.predict_proba(new_df)               # DataFrame, one column per class
model.metrics, model.params, model.feature_columns, model.class_names
```

The saved model includes the run's scaling, polynomial features and feature subset, so pass raw rows.
Models saved before 0.2 (a bare estimator) still load.

Renamed in 0.2: `fetchers` -> `features`, `fetcher_selection()` -> `feature_selection()`,
`brut_force_features()` -> `brute_force_features()`. The old names still work but warn. Imports moved from
`external_classes` / `utils` / `results` into the `ml_pipe` package.

## Usage notes

- `train_test_split(ratio)`: `ratio` is the fraction of rows used for **training** (0.8 = 80% train).
- Scalers and polynomial features (`pipeline.features.standard_scaler()` etc.) are refitted on the
  training rows of every split, so test rows never leak into preprocessing.
- Classification uses stratified splits. All models in a run are scored on the same folds.
- Results carry metrics and predictions only. `filter_by()` (or `refit(results)`) fits the chosen
  models; the fitted model is a scikit-learn `Pipeline` that takes raw rows.
- The worker pool is reused across runs on the same object. Use `with Classification() as c:` or
  call `c.close()` to stop the workers.

## Tests

```
pytest                              # unit tests (load tests are skipped)
pytest --run-load -m load -s        # CPU load tests, a few minutes, prints a CPU timeline
python -m benchmarks.bench          # timing / memory benchmark
```
